## Backend

The backend is an ExpressJS REST API server. 
For the database we use Postgres. To talk to the database, we use [Knex](https://knexjs.org/) query builder. All code related to the backend is located in the `server` folder.<br/>

The REST API provides a single endpoint:
```
GET /butterfiles
```
It returns a list of butterfiles (check the butterfly schema in `server/controllers/butterfly/types.ts`)

## Frontend

Frontend is an SPA built on top of React. For routing we use `react-router-dom` lib. All code related to the frontend is located in the `fe` folder.


## Setup

**1. Install dependencies**
```sh
npm install
```

**2. Create database** (for that you need `docker` and `docker-compose` to be installed on your machine)
```sh
npm run db:init
```
Command above will spin up postgres docker image on your machine (for more details check `server/docker-compose.yaml`), apply migrations from `migrations` folder and apply seeds from `seeds` folder

**3. Run server**
```sh
npm run server:dev
```
Command above will build server source code and run it via nodemon. Nodemon listen for changes in `server` folder (for mre details check `nodemon.json`)

**4. Run frontend**
```sh
npm run fe:dev
```
Command above will run frontend app via `webpack-dev-server` and it will be available on `http://localhost:3000`

## Development
Both backend and frontend are built and running in development mode. To run them both you can launch backend/frontend servers on the separate terminals. In the first terminal run server `npm run server:dev`. In the second terminal run frontend `nnpm run fe:dev`

If you want add new DB migration run next command:
```sh
npm run db:migrate:create [migration_name]
```
It will generate new migration template in `migrations` folder. To apply migrations run:
```sh
npm run db:migrate:up
```

To add new seeds file run next command:
```sh
npm run db:seed:create [seed_name]
```
It will generate new seeds template in `seeds` folder. To apply seeds run:
```sh
npm run db:seed:run
```
